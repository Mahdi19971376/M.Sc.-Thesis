 The aorta is the most compliant vessel in the body. Accurate replication of physiological
 aortic compliance is essential in experimental cardiovascular modeling. The aorta’s flexible
 wall not only enables proper hemodynamic function but also serves as an indicator of
 cardiovascular health and potential pathology.
 This thesis presents the design and characterization of a compliance-controlled chamber
 hosting an aortic phantom within a sealed air–water system. The goal is to mimic phys
iological compliance by regulating the external pressure applied to the phantom. A hy
perelastic constitutive model based on the Mooney–Rivlin formulation is used to describe
 the mechanical behavior of the aortic wall, and theoretical stress–strain relationships are
 derived to evaluate changes in volume and diameter under dynamic pressure conditions.
 The chamber is specifically optimized to reproduce physiological distensibility by tuning
 external boundary conditions. This setup is capable of achieving physiological compli
ance and supporting both steady and pulsatile flow regimes. Finally, a Windkessel-based
 lumped parameter model is developed to provide a first-order estimation of the phantom’s
 hemodynamic performance and pressure–flow characteristics.
