### Abstract
  

 The aorta is the most compliant vessel in the body. Accurate replication of physiological aortic compliance is essential in experimental cardiovascular modeling. The aortaâ€™s flexible wall not only enables proper hemodynamic function but also serves as an indicator ofcardiovascular health and potential pathology.
 This thesis presents the design and characterization of a compliance-controlled chamber hosting an aortic phantom within a sealed airâ€“water system. The goal is to mimic physiological compliance by regulating the external pressure applied to the phantom. A hyperelastic constitutive model based on the Mooneyâ€“Rivlin formulation is used to describe the mechanical behavior of the aortic wall, and theoretical stressâ€“strain relationships are derived to evaluate changes in volume and diameter under dynamic pressure conditions. The chamber is specifically optimized to reproduce physiological distensibility by tuning
external boundary conditions. This setup is capable of achieving physiological compliance and supporting both steady and pulsatile flow regimes. Finally, a Windkessel-based lumped parameter model is developed to provide a first-order estimation of the phantomâ€™s hemodynamic performance and pressureâ€“flow characteristics.
